                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-navy mb-3">Introduction</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">These Terms and Conditions govern your use of Christ Connect, a mobile application designed for Christ University students. By downloading, accessing, or using our app, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. If you disagree with any part of these terms, you should discontinue use of the application immediately.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="mb-8">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-navy mb-3">App Usage and Restrictions</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">By using Christ Connect, these terms will automatically apply to you. You should read them carefully before using the app. You are not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You are prohibited from attempting to extract the source code of the app, and you should not try to translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">The app itself, and all trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, remain the property of the Christ Connect development team. We are committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible for Christ University students. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app at any time and for any reason.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="mb-8">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-navy mb-3">Data and Privacy</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">The Christ Connect app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us in order to provide our Service. It's your responsibility to keep your device and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone's security features, and could mean that the Christ Connect app won't work properly or at all.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">The app does use third-party services, including Google services, that declare their own Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policies.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="mb-8">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-navy mb-3">Limitations of Liability</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">You should be aware that there are certain things that the Christ Connect development team will not take responsibility for:</p>
                
                <div class="ml-4 mb-4">
                    <p class="font-medium mb-2">1. Internet Connection Requirements</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">Certain functions of the app require an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but we cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don't have access to Wi-Fi, and you don't have any of your data allowance left.</p>
                    
                    <p class="font-medium mb-2">2. Data Charges</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">If you're using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In using the app, you are accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory without turning off data roaming.</p>
                    
                    <p class="font-medium mb-2">3. Third-Party Permissions</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you're using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.</p>
                    
                    <p class="font-medium mb-2">4. Device Maintenance</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">We cannot take responsibility for the way you use the app. You need to make sure that your device stays charged â€“ if it runs out of battery and you can't turn it on to access the Service, we cannot accept responsibility.</p>
                    
                    <p class="font-medium mb-2">5. Information Accuracy</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">While we endeavor to ensure that the information in the app is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties, including Google services, to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Christ Connect accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p>

            <section class="mb-8">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-navy mb-3">Updates and Termination</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available for iOS and Android - the requirements for both systems may change, and you'll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. We do not promise that we will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the iOS/Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination:</p>
                <p class="mb-4">(a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;</p>
                <p class="mb-4">(b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.</p>

            <section class="mb-8">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-navy mb-3">Christ University Policies</h3>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-navy mb-3">Class Representative Features</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">If you are granted Class Representative privileges within the app, you agree to use these features responsibly and in accordance with University guidelines. Misuse of announcement capabilities or other CR features may result in the revocation of these privileges.</p>
